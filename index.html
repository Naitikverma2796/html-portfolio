<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><h3>3 Idiots</h3></li>
        <p>This is a must watch movie, everyone should see this movie once in their life. It's basically about a student who is different from all of the other students. His parents also hated him as he was not good in his studies as well. Then a teacher came in his life, and how he understands him, and his abilities and convert that kid to believe himself that what he can actually do....</p>
    <li><h3>Maharaja</h3></li>
        <p>It's one of my favourite movies of tollywood. This story is about a caring father and her daughter. Eventually what happebed to her daughter and how he takes revenge is very intersting. You will get shock at the end of the story....</p>
    <li><h3>Interstellar</h3></li>
        <p>It's the GOAT movie, directed by the famous director Christopher Nolan. This story is about black hole and time travel. You will enjoy this story very much, that's my gaurante...</p>
